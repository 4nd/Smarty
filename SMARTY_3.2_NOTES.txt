Smarty 3.2 Notes
================

Enhancements
------------

    $cache_modified_check
Befor 3.2 the brower cache was not used with cached subtemplates which did have individual cache_lifetime.
Smarty 3.2 does now also check the update time of each cached subtemplate. 

    $use_sub_dirs and $cache_id
In previous versions of Smarty the $use_sub_dirs did not really help when you created cache files with a large
number of different $cache_id's. The subfolder structure for cache files has now been changed that a cache_id hash
is included to limit the number of files in single folders.
    
    template inheritance
Template inheritance is now dynamic and the resolving of {block} replacements is no longer done at compile time
but when rendering. Template code outside {block} tags in child templates is now executed at rendering but no 
output is printed.
Eaxample for child.tpl
 {if $foo} 
  {block name='bar'}   .... {/block}  // this block is only active when $foo is true at rendering
 {/if}
 {$buu = 'blq'}      // does assign variable $buu
 {$buu}              // this out is not printed because it's outside {block} in a chisld template

The {extends} tag can now have a variable file attribute as {extends file=$foo}

Default settings
----------------

    $merge_compiled_include
For maximum redering speed this option is enabled now by default.
Because of this you will no longer see compiled template files of subtemplates in $compile_dir as the compiled code
is merged into the compiled main templates.


Deprecated functionality
------------------------

    registered objects
The use of registered objects has been deprecated and is removed from standard Smarty.
For backward compatibility it is available by the SmartyBC class.


New template features
---------------------

    whitespace control
Whitespaces in front or after tags can now be controlled by the tag itself.
{-tag} remove white space infront of tag up to the previous non-whitespace character or beginning of the line
   "text \n\n\t {-tag}" -> "text \n\n{tag}"
   "text \n\n\t text\t {-tag}" -> "text \n\n\t text{tag}"
{--tag} remove white space infront of tag up to the previous non-whitespace character
   "text \n\n\t {--tag}" -> "text{tag}"
   "text \n\n\t text\t {--tag}" -> "text \n\n\t text{tag}"
{tag-} remove white space after tag up to the next non-whitespace character or end of the line
   "{tag-} \n\n\t text" -> "{tag}\n\n\t text"
   "{tag-} text \n\n\t text" -> "{tag}text \n\n\t text"
{tag--} remove white space after tag up to the next non-whitespace character
   "{tag--} \n\n\t text" -> "{tag}text"
   "{tag--} text \n\n\t text" -> "{tag}text \n\n\t text"
